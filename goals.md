# Goals

- Days of the week
- New, better (more accurate, metrical, and poetic) translations of texts and terms (e.g. Agni Parthene / Pure Virgin; the feasts)
- Elizabethan vs modern English
- the calendar


Ethos: When you have a message to get out there, use the best medium for the job. If you have no message, don't put anything out there. This is about communication and evangelism, i.e. making good propoganda: not making money.

Video: A proposal for Christianised days of the week in English (for Eastern Orthodox Christians)
- style: narrative, highly produced, a la 'The End of Quantum Reality', 'Harmony', and 'Trisagion Films'
- structure: dedication of days of the week in Christianised cultures (Greece, Russia); English retains pagan names; dedications of the days of the week in Orthodox praxis, with historical survey; proposed names and how they would be used (for now, just personally or within Orthodox friend groups and communities; we hope one day that the Anglophone culture will reach a Christian saturation-point, perhaps thanks to the future conversion of the elites, so that the pagan names of the days of the week will sound as foreign to our progeny as the Russian and Greek days of the week sound to the majority of us now.
- theme: the dedication of all things to God, so that no matter where we look, our mind is prompted to remember God: to repent and be healed from our diseases, to receive spiritual consolation and rest from the world, and to be lifted to heavenly things.



Ideas for propoganda:
Video: The beauty of the Orthodox Christian calendar [an explanation of the cycles of the Church calendar; including a closing section about its sad reform at the hand of modernists and Masons]
Video: What is heresy? (Noetic Prayer as the Basis of Mission and the Struggle Against Heresy)
Video: How the West Lost Grace [a narrativisation of Craig Truglia's book]
